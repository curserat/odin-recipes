# odin-recipes

This is a small project showcasing what I've learned from basic HTML.

In this project, I created a recipe website from scratch.
It contains recipes for some of the dishes that I have searched online.

I've also used this project as a way to practice commits for GitHub.

Edit 1: I'm happy with how the website came out. I decided to create a mock restuarant instead of doing a recipe website.
Since I love Star Wars, I decided to make that the theme of my project.
